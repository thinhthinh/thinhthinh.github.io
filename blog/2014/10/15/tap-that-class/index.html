<p>The Tap method reminds me of Nightcrawler, the furry indigo teleporter from the Marvel Universe. He appears out of nowhere, kicks ass, and then disappears in a puff of smoke.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/3ffc21146868e5951dd7e686d4fe9cbe/tumblr_mgr6utyoY31qfhq48o9_r2_250.gif" alt="Nightcrawler teleports" /></p>

<p>The Tap method, born in Ruby >= 1.9, is a helper method that yields a block on your object and returns the object. As a method, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Object
  def tap
    yield self
    self
  end
end
</code></pre>


<p>This is especially useful when you are creating new classes because it allows you to assign properties from the get-go.</p>

<pre><code>#Creating a new hero object
nightcrawler = Hero.new
nightcrawler.name = "Nightcrawler"
nightcrawler

#Refactored with tap
nightcrawler = Hero.new.tap{|h| name = "Nightcrawler"}
</code></pre>


<p>When you have many properties to set, this allows you to group all methods in an easy-to-read tap block.</p>

<pre><code>nightcrawler = Hero.new.tap do |h|
  h.name = "Nightcrawler"
  h.power = "teleportation"
  h.train_under_xavier
  h.runaway
  h.redemption
  h.anything_else_you_want
end
</code></pre>


<p>Refactoring with tap can aid in readability. However, overdoing it with the tap blocks may result in the opposite. With great power, comes great responsibility.</p>

<p>Superpowers in mind, here&rsquo;s the latest track from UK electro-duo Alunageorge. Goodbye for now.</p>
